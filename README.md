This repository includes the following proxies:
      Tree ring width.
      Ice core del18O, deltaD, and accumulation rate.
      Coral delta18O, Sr/Ca, d14C, d13C, 11B, U/Ca, Mg/Ca. 

Most records are at least 50 years long, with nearly annual or better resolution.  The data are not constrained with respect to their climate sensitivity.  All the records are in the public domain. The tree ring set corresponds exactly with the ring width and density time series in the PAGES S1 file, corresponding to the PAGES article in Nature Geoscience.

In April 2015 the archive contained 130 coral records, 180 ice core records, and 425 tree ring records.
