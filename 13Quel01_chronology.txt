# The Summit Dome core was dated by annual layer counting to 683 CE, and was constrained by 
# the 1600 CE Huaynaputina volcanic event. From 682 CE to 226 CE the core was dated using 
# the modeling approach described in the Supplemental Information accompanying the Science (2013) paper. 
# The North Dome core was dated by layer counting to 1395 CE, and was also constrained by the 1600 CE 
# Huaynaputina volcanic event. From 1395 CE to 1000 CE dating was accomplished by matching the 
# isotopic record to that of the Summit Dome core.
